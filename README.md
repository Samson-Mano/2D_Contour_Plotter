# 2D Contour Plotter

**2D Contour Plotter** is a standalone C# software application that enables users to plot 2D contour plots directly from text or CSV files. Built with .NET 4.7 and the OxyPlot library, this tool works similarly to Matplotlib but runs natively on Windows without the need for any compilers or external dependencies like Python.

## Features

- **Standalone Application**: No need to install or configure compilers. Simply download and run the software on any Windows machine.
- **Quick and Easy Plotting**: Quickly generate 2D contour plots from CSV or TXT files containing multi-dimensional data.
- **Intuitive GUI**: User-friendly interface with simple file input and selection options for contour plotting.
- **Supports Multiple Data Types**: Plot single or multiple data columns (e.g., pressure, phase, etc.) with ease.

## Use Case

The software is ideal for users who need a quick, standalone solution for visualizing data in 2D contours. Itâ€™s perfect for engineers, scientists, or data analysts working with CSV or TXT data files and looking for a simple way to generate contour plots without the hassle of complex setup or scripting.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your data**: The software reads CSV or TXT files with data formatted as follows:

   - **Header**: The first row should contain column names (e.g., `x`, `y`, `z1`, `z2`, etc.).
   - **Data**: Each subsequent row should contain numerical values separated by commas. You can have multiple columns for different `z` values (e.g., `Pressure_1`, `Phase_1`, etc.).

   ### Example Data 1 (Multiple `z` Values)
   ```csv
   x,y,Pressure_1,Phase_1,Pressure_2,Phase_2,Pressure_3,Phase_3
   -2.237,0.426,67.477,-1.027,16.950,-54.290,21.998,157.099
   -2.237,1.278,79.329,0.961,19.298,-56.269,24.514,155.832
   -2.237,2.130,93.536,2.507,21.856,-58.239,27.130,154.657
   -2.237,2.983,109.999,3.370,24.527,-60.190,29.725,153.587
   .....
   ..... etc
    ```
    ### Example Data 2 (Single z Value)
    ```csv
    x,y,Pressure_1
    -1.141,0.217,371.857
    -1.141,0.652,454.944
    -1.141,1.087,551.070
    ....
    .... etc
    ```

2. **Load Your Data**: 
   - Click on the **Read CSV** or **Read TXT** button to load your file into the application.
   - Select the appropriate **Z column** (e.g., `Pressure_1`, `Phase_1`, etc.) from the combo box.

3. **Plot the Contour**: 
   - After selecting the desired data column, click the **Plot** button to generate a 2D contour plot based on the input data.

4. **Download**: 
   - To use the software on any Windows machine, download the portable version by clicking the link below:
